# CodeMonkeyType

CodeMonkeyType is a coding speed test program made for code monkeys who wish to level up their code typing skills. This program is written in Python and is designed to run in the terminal. You can use this program to practice upping your coding speed by using real, working solutions for Leetcode problems as the typing content. This is also a great tool to help you  better remember these solutions for your upcoming code interviews!

## Features

- Measures typing speed in Tokens Per Minute (TPM).
- Calculates typing accuracy.
- Highlights correct and incorrect typed characters.
- Displays the typing speed and accuracy in real-time.
- Uses LeetCode solutions as the text content for typing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `curses` library (usually comes pre-installed with Python on Unix-based systems)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the CodeMonkeyType rootdir.
4. Ensure the `LeetcodeSolutions/3sum.cpp` sample text content is present.
5. Run the following command:

   ```console
   $ python3 main.py
