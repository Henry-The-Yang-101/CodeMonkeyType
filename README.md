- Calculates typing accuracy.
- Highlights correct and incorrect typed characters.
- Displays the typing speed and accuracy in real-time.
- Uses LeetCode solutions as the text content for typing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `curses` library (usually comes pre-installed with Python on Unix-based systems)
